      duke.meet was started by 5 Duke students enrolled in CompSci 316 who
      were interested in creating a platform for crowdsourcing top University
      talent. They felt there was a gap in the ability for projects, and startups, to
      advertise to University talent in a simple and concise way, and decided to
      do something to change that. duke.meet combines this ease of posting and advertising
      projects, with being a space for interested students to see what opportunities are
      out there. Whether it be a class project or a startup idea, duke.meet aims to be the
      go to platform for connecting University talent to exciting projects!
